# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Leandro! 

I am 21 year old dreamer that is currently residing in Salt Lake City, Utah. 


## ðŸš€ About Me
I love python, and julia. Hopefully one day I will fall in love with Rust or Dart/Flutter.
I've been developing a lot of websites with Django lately. Django is nice because it can serve
both for the back-end and front-end of websites. I use julia for anything that requires performance as
the syntax is very similar to python. I am trying to learn Flutter because I want to be
able to develop IOS and Android apps. Flutter serves both architectures with only one code base. As for Rust,
I haven't found a real use to it. I might migrate some of my Django Rest APIs to Rust and create micro-sevices.
